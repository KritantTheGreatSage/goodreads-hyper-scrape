# goodreads-hyper-scrape
It is a web scraping program that run searches of book titles from a text file on Goodreads and scrape the author name, book title, ratings and rating count and save it to a CSV file.
The program will scrape data from all the searches from a single book title; therefore adding the sequels of the book title is unnecessary.
Each book title will yield about 20 books worth of data.

I used Spyder(Python 3.7) to run the program, along with the library of BeautifulSoup:

-install BeautifulSoup ( pip install beautifulsoup4)
-avoid writing book sequels titles

This project was inspired by my fascination of wanting to know what is best rated books that I should read from suggestions of popular websites and TheGuardian.
I will put a link here for the all book titles scraped.

-Have fun ^^
